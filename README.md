Checkers
========

This is one of the first programs I ever wrote. It is a simple checkers game written in Java. 

I can count the many things I would change if I was to re-do it, however, I like keeping it around to take a look at how far I have come as a programmer. 

It does work however, so you can play with 2 players locally (no AI)
